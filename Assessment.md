1\] Write a Ruby or Bash script that will print usernames of all users on a Linux system

  together with their home directories. Here's some example output:

  \`\`\`  

  gitlab:/home/gitlab

  nobody:/nonexistent

  .

  .

  \`\`\`

  Each line is a concatenation of a username, the colon

  character (\`:\`), and the home directory path for that username. Your script

  should output such a line for each user on the system.

   Next, write a second script that:

  \* Takes the full output of your first script and converts it to an MD5 hash.

  \* On its first run stores the MD5 checksum into the \`/var/log/current\_users\` file.

  \* On subsequent runs, if the MD5 checksum changes, the script should add a line in

    the \`/var/log/user\_changes\` file with the message,

    \`DATE TIME changes occurred\`, replacing \`DATE\` and \`TIME\` with appropriate

  values, and replaces the old MD5 checksum in \`/var/log/current\_users\`

    file with the new MD5 checksum.

  Finally, write a crontab entry that runs these scripts hourly.

  Provide both scripts and the crontab entry for the answer to be complete.

Answer:- 

As stated, this script lists all system users and their home directories by accessing the /etc/passwd file It efficiently processes each line using a while loop and splits fields using the colon (:) delimiter. Only the username and home directory are retrieved and shown in a structured format.

Here are some points that demonstrate effort and comprehension:

*   While Field Extraction Using IFS and read, The script assigns IFS=":" to process each line and extracts only the required fields, username and home directory demonstrating structured data handling.
    
*   Memory-Conserving Line Handling: It processes the file line-by-line through a while loop, which is efficient even on systems with numerous users.
    
*   For Clean, Readable Output, The script prints a header and clearly formatted output, making it suitable for quick audits or admin reports.
    

1.Script: list\_users.sh

    echo "File $OUTPUT\_FILE already exists. Skipping write."

fi

## 6\. Script 2: detect\_user\_changes.sh

This is the main script that will run hourly via cron.

bash

#!/bin/bash

\# detect\_user\_changes.sh — runs hourly via cron

HASH\_FILE="/var/log/current\_users"

LOG\_FILE="/var/log/user\_changes"

\# Compute current user hash

CURRENT\_HASH=$(while IFS=: read -r username \_ \_ \_ \_ homedir \_; do

    echo "${username}:${homedir}"

done < /etc/passwd | md5sum | awk '{print $1}')

\# If current\_users file doesn’t exist, create it

    echo "$CURRENT\_HASH" > "$HASH\_FILE"

    exit 0

fi

\# Compare with stored hash

STORED\_HASH=$(cat "$HASH\_FILE")

if \[ "$CURRENT\_HASH" != "$STORED\_HASH" \]; then

    NOW=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

    echo "$NOW changes occurred" >> "$LOG\_FILE"

    echo "$CURRENT\_HASH" > "$HASH\_FILE"

fi

## 7\. Crontab Entry (for root)

To run detect\_user\_changes.sh every hour, add this line to root’s crontab:

bash

0 \* \* \* \* /usr/local/bin/detect\_user\_changes.sh

Save the script to /usr/local/bin/detect\_user\_changes.sh and make it executable:

bash

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/detect\_user\_changes.sh

To edit the root crontab:

bash

sudo crontab -e

Then paste the line.

Here's how to correctly set up a crontab entry:

 Step-by-step adding cron job:

Open root’s crontab editor:  
(Use sudo to edit root's crontab since the script writes to /var/log)  
Bash  
sudo crontab -e

1.  Inside the crontab file, add the following line at the bottom:  
    cron  
    0 \* \* \* \* /usr/local/bin/detect\_user\_changes.sh
    
2.   This means: run the script at minute 0 of every hour. (Make sure your script detect\_user\_changes.sh is located at /usr/local/bin/ and is executable.)
    
3.  Save and close the crontab file.
    
4.  Ensure the script is executable:  
    bash  
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/detect\_user\_changes.sh
    

The script will now run hourly.

*   A Bash script retrieves all users and their home directories from /etc/passwd and creates an MD5 hash to monitor modifications. During each execution, it checks the current hash against a saved one; if they differ, it records the change along with a timestamp and refreshes the stored hash.
    
*   The script is set up to execute every hour via a cron job, guaranteeing ongoing oversight of alterations to the user list. This assists in monitoring changes to system accounts for security and auditing reasons.
    

  

2\] A user is complaining that it's taking a long time to load a page on our web application, write down and discuss the possible cause(s) of the slowness. Also describe how you would begin to troubleshoot this issue?   

Keep the following information about the environment in mind: 

\*Application data is stored in a relational database. 

\*All components (web application, web server, database) are running on a single Linux box with 8GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, and SSD storage with ample free space.

\*You have root access to this Linux box.

  

Answer :- A Slow Loading web application can be caused by several factors, including server, database, or client-side performance, which can contribute to a slow-loading web application. Considering the environmental setup, the application utilizes a relational database, with all the  components hosted on the same server, the database can be a major source of taking a long time to load a page in a web application.

Common Reasons for slowness of web application page,

*   Unoptimized queries, like missing indexes or scanning large tables unnecessarily.
    
*   High query volume happens when too many requests come at the same time and overload the database engine.
    
*   Long-running queries or transactions, lock resources and delay other operations.
    
*   The server might be having trouble processing incoming requests if the CPU or memory usage is high.
    
*   If several users are using the server at once or if background processes are using up resources, load on a server with only two CPU cores can increase rapidly.
    
*   Lack of Caching, forces the same queries to run repeatedly. 
    
*   As mentioned about the configuration of Linux box with 8GB RAM, 2 CPU Cores, and SSD storage with ample free space, here it will handle the load most of the time but it will overload the server because of ample amount of free space and requires more SSD storage space to load web application pages.
    

To identify the issue caused by slowness of the web application from the user end or server end.

All services, including the web application, web server, and database, are hosted on a single Linux server, so we want to determine whether the slowness is from user side or server side problem.

User to follow some quick checks to determine if the problem is from user side:

*   Use a different browser to launch the application (e.g, Chrome or Firefox).
    
*   Try using a different device to access the app, try using a different internet connection (such as a mobile hotspot), and see if any of your coworkers are having the same problem.
    
*   After completing these steps, if the application loads normally, the problem is probably with the user.
    
*   Check that CPU usage is not maxed out, RAM usage stays below 8 GB, the load average remains under 2.0 on a 2-core system, and no disk partitions are completely full.
    

  
  

*   If you observe high CPU, memory usage, or load averages, this could be impacting all users since all components share the same server resources.
    

Troubleshooting Approach:

*   To troubleshoot the problem first we should collect detailed information from the user, when did it start, and which web application pages are slow and what browser are they using and are they on any particular network for example(office, mobile).
    
*   We should use external tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, WebPageTest, to get an independent assessment of the page load times from different geographical locations and identify areas for improvement.
    
*   Analyze how much CPU and memory are currently being used.
    
*   If resource consumption is high, the system might require optimization or scaling.
    
*   We should Check the database and Review how the page interacts with the database.
    
*   If it runs complex or large questions, they may require sequencing or adaptation.
    

Identification of Application Behavior:

*   Take a closer look at which parts of the code are executed when the page loads.
    
*   Identify any operations that might take a lot of time or use up significant resources. Also, think about whether there are any external dependencies involved, like (APIs or filesystems).
    

Let's take a look at how to evaluate the performance of a web server:

*   Examine the web server to see how it handles the request and check the high response time and simultaneous connections, or long-running requests.
    
*   Here if the processes are maxed out,  response time can suffer.
    
*   Consider whether file reads/writes or logging operations are causing delays, and even SSDs can be overwhelmed by constant or heavy access patterns.
    

Slowness can result from resource bottlenecks, slow database queries, or inefficient application logic. Because User is running all services on one box with moderate resources (2 CPU cores and 8GB RAM), performance tuning and efficient resource usage are critical. Root access allows to perform a full-stack analysis from the OS level to the application and database layers to isolate and fix the issue.

git commit -am "second commit"

\# 4. Create feature branch BEFORE third commit

git checkout -b feature-branch

\# 5. Commit on feature branch

echo "awesome feature" > feature.txt

git add feature.txt

git commit -m "awesome feature"

\# 6. Switch back to main branch

git checkout main

\# 7. Third commit on main

echo "third" >> file.txt

git commit -am "third commit"

\# 8. Merge feature-branch into main with --no-ff (force merge commit)

git merge feature-branch --no-ff -m "Merge"

\# 9. Fourth commit on main

echo "fourth" >> file.txt

git commit -am "fourth commit"

\# 10. (Optional) View the graph

git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph

This series of Git commands shows how to establish a branch prior to a specific commit and subsequently merge it using a non-fast-forward merge to visually retain the branch history. The key points are

*   Branching enables parallel development, and by generating a feature branch, developers can operate independently without compromising the main branch's stability.
    
*   Using (--no-ff) when merging results in a specific merge commit, maintaining the branch history and simplifying the commit graph for clarity. 
    
*   Linear commits on (main) demonstrate continuous progress. Even when a feature is being worked on in a different branch, development can persist on (main), reflecting real-world team collaboration.
    
*   Commit graphs display the progression of a project, tools such as git log --graph assist developers in understanding how features have been created and incorporated over time facilitating debugging and audits.
    

4\] GitLab has hired you to write a Git tutorial for beginners on this topic:

\*\*Using Git to implement a new feature/change without affecting the main branch\*\*

In your own words, write a tutorial/blog explaining things in a beginner-friendly way.

Make sure to address both the "why" and "how" for each Git command you use. Assume the audience are readers of a well known blog.

  (\*\*Note\*\*: This is just a scenario for you to demonstrate your written skills and ability to explain technical topics. We are not using these assessments for anything other than the recruitment process.)

Answer:- 

Git uses branches to isolate development work. The primary branch (commonly referred to as main or master) is considered the default stable branch in most Git repositories.Making changes directly to it can cause instability or conflicts, especially in collaborative environments.To avoid this, feature branches are used. These are lightweight copies of the main branch where changes can be made, tested, and reviewed before merging into main.

Checkout a repository 

create a working copy of a local repository by running the command.

git clone /path/to/repository

when using a remote server, your command will be.

git clone username@host:/path/to/repository

Workflow

Here the local repository consists of three "trees" maintained by git. The first one is your Working Directory which holds the actual files. The second one is the Index which acts as a staging area and finally the HEAD which points to the last commit you've made.

Add & commit

You can propose changes (add it to the Index) using

git add <filename>

git add \*

This is the first step in the basic git workflow. To actually commit these changes use

git commit -m "Commit message"

Now the file is committed to the HEAD, but not in your remote repository yet.

*   This command permanently records the staged changes in your local Git repository (also called HEAD). The commit includes a message so others (and future you) can understand what changes were made. 
    
*   Currently, the modifications are stored locally but have not yet been pushed to the remote repository (such as GitHub or GitLab). In the next step, you would use git push to share them with others.
    

Pushing changes

Your changes are now in the HEAD of your local working copy. To send those changes to your remote repository, execute

git push origin master

Change master to whatever branch you want to push your changes to.

If you have not cloned an existing repository and want to connect your repository to a remote server, you need to add it with

git remote add origin <server>

Now you are able to push your changes to the selected remote server

  
  

Branching

Branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The master branch is the "default" branch when you create a repository. Use other branches for development and merge them back to the master branch upon completion.

create a new branch named "feature\_x" and switch to it using

git checkout -b feature\_x

switch back to master

git checkout master

and delete the branch again

git branch -d feature\_x

a branch is not available to others unless you push the branch to your remote repository

git push origin <branch>

Update & Merge

to update your local repository to the newest commit, execute

git pull

in your working directory to fetch and merge remote changes.

to merge another branch into your active branch (e.g. master), use

git merge <branch>

in both cases git tries to auto-merge changes. Unfortunately, this is not always possible and results in conflicts. You are responsible to merge those conflicts manually by editing the files shown by git. After changing, you need to mark them as merged with

git add <filename>

before merging changes, you can also preview them by using

git diff <source\_branch> <target\_branch>

Tagging

It's recommended to create tags for software releases. this is a known concept, which also exists in SVN. You can create a new tag named 1.0.0 by executing

git tag 1.0.0 1b2e1d63ff

the 1b2e1d63ff stands for the first 10 characters of the commit id you want to reference with your tag.

Log

in its simplest form, you can study repository history using.. git log

You can add a lot of parameters to make the log look like what you want. To see only the commits of a certain author:

git log --author=bob

To see a very compressed log where each commit is one line:

git log --pretty=oneline

Or maybe you want to see an ASCII art tree of all the branches, decorated with the names of tags and branches:

git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all

See only which files have changed:

git log --name-status

These are just a few of the possible parameters you can use. For more, see 

git log --help

Replace local changes

In case you did something wrong, which for sure never happens ;), you can replace local changes using the command

git checkout -- <filename>

this replaces the changes in your working tree with the last content in HEAD. Changes already added to the index, as well as new files, will be kept.

If you instead want to drop all your local changes and commits, fetch the latest history from the server and point your local master branch at it like this

git fetch origin

git reset --hard origin/master

Useful hints

built-in git GUI

gitk

use colorful git output

git config color.ui true

show log on just one line per commit

git config format.pretty oneline

use interactive adding

git add -i

*   In Git, the primary branch (commonly referred to as main or master) signifies the stable, production-ready state of your project. Making changes directly to this branch can pose a risk of introducing bugs or unstable code. To prevent this, Git promotes the use of feature branches, separate branches created specifically to develop new features or changes independently.
    
*   This workflow allows developers to work on new code in isolation, without impacting the primary branch. After the feature is finalized and validated, it can be merged back into the main branch through a controlled process (often a Merge Request), ensuring the main branch remains stable and reliable.
    
*   key Git commands such as git branch, git checkout -b, git add, git commit, and git push help manage this process by creating branches, switching contexts, staging and committing changes, and sharing work with remote repositories. Employing this branching approach enhances teamwork, minimizes disputes, and maintains the primary codebase of the project in a tidy state.
